# Ping Identity DevOps

We enable DevOps, administrators and developers with tools, frameworks, blueprints and reference architectures to deploy Ping Identity software in the cloud.

## Why Containerization?

* **Deployments with Confidence** 

  Maintain all configurations and dependencies ensuring consistent environments. Eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem.

* **Cloud Flexibility** 

  Containers are portable. All major cloud providers have embraced containers and have added support.

* **Right-Size** 

  Orchestration of containers allows businesses to increase fault tolerance, availability and cost management by auto-scaling to application demand.
  
We use Docker images of Ping Identity software solutions to provide you with stable, network-enabled containers. For lightweight orchestration purposes, we use Docker Compose. For enterprise-level orchestration of containers, we use Kubernetes.  

## Choose Your Path

Our documentation will guide you through these pathways:

* Evaluate our solutions. See [Evaluate our solutions](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/docs/evaluate.md)
* Use containers and orchestration built and maintained by us. See [Use DevOps-built containers](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/docs/devopsBuilt.md)
* Build, orchestrate, and maintain your own containers. See [Build your own containers](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/docs/buildYourOwn.md)

None of these pathways are exclusive. Each may fulfill a different purpose as you develop your containerization strategy. If you're uncertain where to start, evaluate our solutions to see how it all works.
