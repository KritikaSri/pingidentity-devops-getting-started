# Working with the examples

You can continue working with the full stack of product containers as you did in [Get started](evaluate.md), or you can try different configurations, such as a single container or another container stack.

We've example configurations to help you quickly try this out:

 * [A single Docker container](deployStandalone.md).
 * [A PingFederate and PingDirectory stack using Docker Compose](deployCompose.md).
 * [A replicated pair of solutions using Docker Compose](deployReplication.md).
 * [Data synchronization for PingDirectory using PingDataSync](deploySync.md).
 * A stack using Docker Swarm.
 * PingDirectory using Kubernetes.
