# Manage deployments

You can continue to deploy the full stack of solutions as you did in [Get started](evaluate.md), or you can deploy a single container or a container stack.

We've example configurations to help you quickly deploy:

 * [A single Docker container](deployStandalone.md).
 * [A PingFederate and PingDirectory stack using Docker Compose](deployCompose.md).
 * [A replicated pair of solutions using Docker Compose](deployReplication.md).
 * [Data synchronization for PingDirectory using PingDataSync](deploySync.md).
 * A stack using Docker Swarm.
 * PingDirectory using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

  * You've already been through [Get started](evaluate.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.
