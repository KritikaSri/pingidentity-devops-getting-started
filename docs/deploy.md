# Working with the examples

You can continue working with the full stack of product containers as you did in [Get started](getStarted.md), or you can try different configurations, such as a single container or another container stack.

Our example configurations will help you quickly try this out:

 * [A single product container](deployStandalone.md).
 * [A PingFederate and PingDirectory stack](deployCompose.md).
 * [A replicated pair of products](deployReplication.md).
 * [Data synchronization for PingDirectory using PingDataSync](deploySync.md).
 * [Orchestrate deployments using Docker Swarm](deploySwarm.md).
   - [PingFederate clustering using Docker Swarm and AWS S3](swarmPfCluster.md). 
 * [Orchestrate deployments using Kubernetes](deployKubernetes.md).
