# Working with the examples

You can continue working with the full stack of product containers as you did in [Get started](getStarted.md), or you can try different configurations, such as standalone containers or another container stack.

Our example configurations will help you quickly try this out:

* [Deploy standalone product containers](deployStandalone.md).
* [Deploy a PingFederate and PingDirectory stack](deployCompose.md).
* [Deploy a replicated pair of products](deployReplication.md).
* [Deploy PingDirectory with data synchronization using PingDataSync](deploySync.md).
* [Orchestrate deployments using Docker Swarm](deploySwarm.md).
  - [PingFederate clustering using Docker Swarm and AWS S3](swarmPfCluster.md). 
* [Orchestrate deployments using Kubernetes](deployKubernetes.md).
  - [Kubernetes deployments for general use](docs/deployK8sGeneral.md).
  - [PingDirectory deployments across Kubernetes clusters](docs/deployK8sPD-clusters.md).
  - [Kubernetes deployments for general use](docs/deployK8sGeneral.md).
  - [Kubernetes deployments for cloud platforms](docs/deployK8sCloud.md).
  - [Deployments to Amazon Web Services EKS](docs/deployK8s-AWS.md).
  - [Deployments to Azure Kubernetes Service](docs/deployK8s-AKS.md).
