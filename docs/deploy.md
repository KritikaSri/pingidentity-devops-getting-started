# Manage deployments

You can continue to deploy the full stack of solutions as you did in Getting Started, or you can deploy a single solution or a different set of solutions.

We've example configurations to help you quickly deploy:

 * [A single solution as a standalone Docker container](deployStandalone.md).

    See [Docker standalone](../10-docker-standalone/README.md) for the available solutions.

 * [A PingFederate and PingDirectory stack using Docker Compose](docs/deployCompose.md).

    See [Docker standalone](../11-docker-compose/01-simple-stack/README.md) for additional information and the associated YAML file.

 * [A replicated pair of solutions using Docker Compose](docs/deployReplication.md).

   See [Docker Compose for replicated pairs](../11-docker-compose/02-replicated-pair/README.md) for additional information.

 * [Data synchronization for PingDirectory using Docker Compose](docs/deploySync.md).

   See [Simple synchronization](../11-docker-compose/04-simple-sync/README.md) for additional information.

 * A solutions stack using Docker Swarm.


 * PingDirectory using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

  * You've already been through [Getting Started](../evaluate.md) to set up your environment and run a test deployment of the solutions.
