# Manage deployments

You can continue to deploy the full stack of solutions as you did in [Get started](evaluate.md), or you can deploy a single container or a container stack.

We've example configurations to help you quickly deploy:

 * [A single Docker container](deployStandalone.md).

    See [Docker standalone](../10-docker-standalone/README.md) for the available products.

 * [A PingFederate and PingDirectory stack using Docker Compose](deployCompose.md).

    See [Simple stack](../11-docker-compose/01-simple-stack/README.md) for additional information and the associated YAML file.

 * [A replicated pair of solutions using Docker Compose](deployReplication.md).

   See [Docker Compose for replicated pairs](../11-docker-compose/02-replicated-pair/README.md) for additional information.

 * [Data synchronization for PingDirectory using Docker Compose](deploySync.md).

   See [Simple synchronization](../11-docker-compose/04-simple-sync/README.md) for additional information.

 * A stack using Docker Swarm.


 * PingDirectory using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

  * You've already been through [Get started](evaluate.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.
