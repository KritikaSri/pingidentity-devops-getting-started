# What's new

I expect this to be presented in a topical format (as opposed to a change log) addressing:

  1. New release versions, features/capabilities (ie, images, profiles, scripts)
  2. New behaviors (ie, operational results)
  3. Changed features/capabilities or behaviors in new release
  4. Any deployment limitations to existing features/capabilities or behaviors (current or prior supported releases)
  5. Any deprecated features/capabilities in new release
