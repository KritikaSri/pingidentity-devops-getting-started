# YAML files for orchestrated solutions


  * Add or change environment variables in the YAML file.
  * Add references to a file or files containing environment variables to the YAML file.

  ### To add or change environment variables in the YAML file for an orchestrated example:

    1. Open the YAML file associated with an [example orchestrated deployment](../pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/README.md). For example, the [YAML file for a simple stack](../11-docker-compose/01-simple-stack/docker-compose.yaml).
