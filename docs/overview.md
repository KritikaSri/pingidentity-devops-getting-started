# Overview

The DevOps resources include deployment examples and configuration management tools, with documentation guides for how to use these, as well as how to customize the DevOps images for your own purposes.

When you're ready, begin with our [Getting started](evaluate.md) guide. Our documentation will guide you through using the DevOps resources:

## DevOps images

We make available preconfigured images of Ping Identity solutions. Each solution is configured to be a working, immediately usable image for deployment to a Docker container. The solutions are also integrated, configured to interoperate with any of the other available solutions.

You'll find information about our available solutions in [Docker images](../../pingidentity-docker-builds) or on our [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pingidentity/) site.

The DevOps image or images are automatically pulled from our repository the first time you deploy a solution container or orchestrated set of containers. Alternatively, you can pull the images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pingidentity/).

## Deployment examples

We supply examples for deploying our solutions as standalone containers, as a container stack using Docker Compose, as a replicated pair of containers using Docker Compose, as an orchestrated set of containers using Docker Swarm, and as an orchestrated set of containers using Kubernetes.

## Configuration management

We use server profiles, environment variables, and release tags to pass configuration data to the solution containers at startup.

### Server profiles

Server profiles are

### Environment variables


### Release tags


## Custom images
