# Purpose
The easiest way to get started with kubernetes is probably to get familiar with Minikube, an all-in-one local kubernetes turn-key cluster.

I tried to make this as simple as possible to better demonstrate specifically only the basics of kubernetes with PingDirectory here rather than confuse the issue with other things more specific to Docker or the rest of the automation that is coming next.

## Pre-requisites
You will need:
- Minikube: [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- kubectl: [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

## What to look at
- env_vars: environment variable that will be expanded from template to produce a working deployment
-
